# Roll20-Dark-Theme
Dark theme for Roll20. Fully compatible with the base editor as well as the 5e Shaped and OGL sheets.
Also compatible with the VTT Enhancement Suite (formerly Roll20 Enhancement Suite) extension!

This is a fork of RedReign's code so I can keep it updated as they haven't released recently. 

## Installation:
- Install the [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) extension on your browser.

  (Greasemonkey and other userscript extensions may work, but are not currently supported.)
- [Download and open the userscript in your browser](https://openuserjs.org/install/RedReign/Roll20_Dark.user.js).

- Enjoy!
